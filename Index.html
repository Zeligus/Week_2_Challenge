    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Hashim DeLorme, I am currently a student in a course for software/development 
        that is teaching me how to become a fullstack developer. My hopes are to take the skills I am learning from this course 
        and turn them into a career. This portfolio is how I'd like to showcase my growing set of skills
        and projects that I have completed.
